BUILDING FROM GITHUB:
=====================

git clone https://github.com/junit-team/junit.git
cd junit
mvn install

BUILDING FROM JARS OR ZIPS:
===========================

The contents of the zip and jar files are largely maintained for historical
reasons.  We do not at this time have an official way to build from the src
jar or zip.  If this is an important missing feature, please let us know
at http://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues
