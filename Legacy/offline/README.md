This is the highlevel directory for all offline tools for the robobuggy project.

At time it is not practical to complete a task online (as the system is running).  This is either because the task is too resource intensive to be done in realtime, or the task is easier to do offline. For example a prototype of an algorithm can be developed offline before it is done online.

This folder is split based on what the type of tool is:
* mapping -> for generating maps of the course
* pathPlanning -> for generating plans of how the buggy should travel the course
* calibration -> for sensor calibration
* debugging -> for system debugging
* prototyping -> for prototyping of a system
* analytics -> for calculating analytics about how the system is performing (offline, NOTE: some analytics are calculated in real time)
* simulator -> all simulation of the system
