* update documentation
	* new cook's tour
	* update Test Infected
* Should there be a "prefix" annotation for Suites?
  * This would allow two Suites with different BeforeClass/AfterClass behaviors,
    but the same component tests, to co-exist

* update the build process
    * update site for plug-in version?
* Ant
	* Basic task
* support testing run once initialization code e.g. class Foo {{...}}
* Automatically add failing tests to the Known Defects section of the README.html

* Create assume(that()) and assert(that()) 
  (what is a better name for the second one?)
  
* Simplify implementation of equality, and organize AssertionTest

* Theories class validation should be much better

* Find a way to make Parameterized a single-class extension

* If a suite() returns a JUnit4TestAdapter, allow Filters and Sorters to operate on 
  the adapted Runner.
  
* Every time I add a Filter feature, I have to add an equivalent Sorter feature.  Suspicious.
