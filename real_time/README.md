This is is the top level for the robobuggy real time system 

the real time system encompasses all code which is running online (in real time) on the buggy 

The source code for the real time system is separated based on where the code is being executed 
* arduino_src  -> code for the onboard arduino 
* surface_src -> code for the on board high level computer (currently a Microsoft surface pro 2)
